Roadmap
=======

Where this is headed. What are the goals. Why do we want to get there.

The goal of SumoJS, is to achieve 100% modularity. Utilizing RequireJS, SumoJS hopes to add true
targeted builds to the MV* equation.

There are underlying goals as well.

* Stay in the Micro Library Space (small)
* Stay in the Single Purpose Space (SumoJS should and will define an API, nothing more)
* Exploit Modular Design, for Developer Choice
* Stay Simple
* No ETA
* Always Fix Bugs
* Always refactor, and remove debt
* Stop being clever, right clean, readable code for tomorrow
